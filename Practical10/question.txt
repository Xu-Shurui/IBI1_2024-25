Discussion: 
The analysis reveals interesting trends in the DALYs relationship between China and the UK:
1. In the early years (1990s), China had significantly higher DALYs than the UK.
2. Both countries show a general downward trend in DALYs over time, indicating improvements in population health.
3. The gap between China and the UK has been narrowing, especially after 2000, suggesting China has been making faster improvements in health outcomes.
4. The difference plot shows that while China started with DALYs about 20,000 higher than the UK, this difference reduced to less than 2500 by 2019.
