# The code above is a simple drug dosage calculator that takes a patient's weight and the strength of the drug as input and calculates the required volume of the drug in milliliters. It checks if the weight is within a valid range (between 10 and 100 kg) and if the strength is either 120 or 250 mg/5ml. If any of these conditions are not met, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate message.
